## Controllers 
 - Resources  - [Docs](https://docs.nestjs.com/controllers)
 - Controllers are responsible for handling incoming requests and returning responses to the client.
 - A DTO (Data Transfer Object) is an object that defines how the data will be sent over the network.
 - To create a controller using the CLI, simply execute the command.
  ```
  $ nest g controller <ObjectName>
  ```

## Provides
 - A provider is simply a class annotated with an @Injectable() decorator.
 - Many of the basic Nest classes may be treated as a provider â€“ services, repositories, factories, helpers, and so on.
 - <b>Services:</b> will be responsible for data storage and retrieval, and is designed to be used by the `controller`
  - To create a service using the CLI, simply execute the command.
  ```
  $ nest g service <ObjectName>
  ```
  - <b>Dependency injection:</b> the use of the `private` syntax. This shorthand allows us to both declare and initialize the `<Service>` member immediately in the same location

## Modules
 - Each application has at least one module, a <b>root module </b> `app.module.ts`
 - Modules are effect way to organize your components
 - The @Module() is a single object whose properties: 
    * providers: the providers that will be instantiated by the Nest injector and that may be shared at least across this module
    * controllers: the set of controllers defined in this module which have to be instantiated
    * imports: the list of imported modules that export the providers which are required in this module (re-exporting module)
    * exports: the subset of providers that are provided by this module and should be available in other modules which import this module
  - To create a module using the CLI, simply execute the command.
  ```
  $ nest g module <ObjectName>
  ```
  - Shared modules: 
    * Modules are <b>singletons</b> by default.
    * Every module is automatically a shared module. 
    * Once created it can be reused by any module.

## Middleware 
 - Middleware is a function which is called before the route handler
 - Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
    * execute any code.
    * make changes to the request and the response objects.
    * end the request-response cycle.
    * call the next middleware function in the stack.
    * if the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.
 - To create a middleware using the CLI, simply execute the command.
  ```
  $ nest g middleware <ObjectName>
  ```
